Mr. [**Known patient lastname 25575**] is a 58 yo m w/ multiple sclerosis and seizure disorder who presented to an OSH for delusions and AMS x 2 days. At OSH, he was noted to have a Na of 124. He does have a history of hyponatremia; he had a Na of 117 in [**4-6**] but had been in the mid 130s since then. He has seen nephrology. At the OSH, he had an approx 45sec generalized tonic clonic seizure, received 1mg Ativan, and transferred to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**]. He also has a history of seizures especially in the setting of infection and hyponatremia. It is unclear if he has had seizures without an inciting event. He is currently being weaned off of Keppra and Gabapentin and is being started on Tegretol. In the ER, his VS were: 97.5; 189/105; 78; 16; 95% 3L. He was given 2L of NS. Given that he has had AMS in the setting of infection and is known to have chronic UTIs [**2-1**] indwelling suprapubic catheter and neurogenic bladder, blood and urine cultures were obtained as well as a CXR. He had a urine culture from [**1-6**] that grew pseudomonas and his CXR showed a possible infiltrate and he was treated with vancomycin and cefepime. A head CT was negative.

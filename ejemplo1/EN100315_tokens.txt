The delay to consult was 5 hours after the incident . The clinical examination at admission had showed a deformed left superior member , painful on palpation with the presence of the humeral pulse and a right inferior member shortened and flexed , the thigh slightly in adduction , internal rotation with the member . A radiological assessment was performed immediately ; including a standard X-ray of the pelvis which showed a dislocated head of the right femur , completed secondarily by a CT Scan of the hip confirming the posterior type of the dislocation isolated from any fractures of the head of the femur . The standard radiography of the left shoulder showed a Salter I epiphyseal separation of the humerus . After one hour , we performed an orthopedic reduction of the dislocated hip monitored under scope , with placement of a pelvic splint for an analgesic aim to be kept during three weeks . The radiological results were satisfactory with a restored bilateral symmetry of the articular anatomy . The Salter I detachment of the humerus was orthopedically reduced then immobilized by a thoracoabdominal plaster be kept during a month . The child has been discharged the next day .
